### carbon
======
A lightweight dependenciy injection library based on bottlejs and angularjs, but without features that are not always used


###### TODO/REVIEW
- [x] services
- [x] factories
- [x] modules

1. How can we make the library easily extendible?
2. How do we use modules to start something?  We need a wrapper, but where in module or carbon level?
3. Should we handle * imports?  Technically it's bad to include all instead of just what you need
