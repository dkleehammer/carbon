======
An extendible lightweight, non-opinionated, dependenciy injection library and nothing more.


###### TODO/REVIEW
- [x] services
- [x] factories
- [x] modules
- [x] wrap
- [ ] test cases (list in carbon.test.js file)

2. Names probably need to be contain type, e.g. Factory should be appended to the end of the stored name, right now .service('Test') could be a factory
