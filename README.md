### carbon
======
A lightweight dependenciy injection library based on bottlejs and angularjs, but without features that are not always used


###### TODO/REVIEW
- [x] services
- [x] factories
- [x] application
- [ ] modules

How can we make the library easily extendible?  Should modules be a complete instance of carbon and be injectable into applications?  Should the service & factories be application based (instances are not on the global cabon, but rather on the app instance)?
